Gabbo is a basic chat app built with a Javascript front end and Ruby on Rails back end. Gabbo uses a dropdown user option instead of user authentication, which begs the question - who are we really talking to, and why?

Getting started:
To run this app, clone the repo and run 'bundle install'. Then, run 'rails s' to start a server. You should see the app running on 'localhost:3000'.

Prerequisites:
You will need to have Ruby installed on your machine.

Built with:
-Ruby on Rails, our web framework
-ActiveRecord, our ORM
-Json API Serializer
-CORS
